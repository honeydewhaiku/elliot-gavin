                  by Elliot Gavin Keenan</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Introduction</b><br>
                <i>by Matthew D. Lerner, PhD</i></center>
              <br>
              <br>
              There exist several species of book in the “mental health memoir”
              genre. The first and arguably most popular is the one offering the
              author’s <i>subjective experience</i> of struggles and successes.
              Such manuscripts range in tone from journalistic to poetic,
              offering an intimate, probing portrait of the author as a
              wellspring of empathy and individual truth; when they touch the
              reader, they ring like a bell, revealing resonances previously
              unknown. <br>
              <br>
              A second is the <i>empirical or historical review</i>. Such
              explorations are often precisely that – a journey into caverns and
              stacks of psychiatry and psychology’s often-tangled attempts to
              define human experience into neat categories; the inevitable
              unraveling of first principles of the mind; and, finally, an
              accounting of the more humble, tenuous attempts of current
              scientists to make sense of what (little) is known today, and to
              square that with the life that led the author to embark on such a
              quest. These are often historically-grounded and -informed,
              consistent with contemporary literature, and serve as a means to
              smuggle current clinical science into the hands of readers who
              might not read peer-reviewed journals. <br>
              <br>
              A third is the <i>clinical perspective</i>. These curious tomes
              serve as a kind of meta-perspective-taking game in which a
              searchlight bounces purposefully between the minds of individuals
              seeking treatment for the challenges they experience, the
              clinicians who aim to help, and – finally – to the author again,
              who orients the spinning moral lodestone of the narrative. Such
              evaluations are notably measured in their approach, both revealing
              and systematizing, providing both reader and characters new
              personal insights. <br>
              <br>
              The book you hold in your hand, then, is perhaps something unique
              to date: a true hybrid representing a potentially new emanation of
              the genus. Mr. Keenan’s abundant literary talents are in bloom
              here, as he paints hazy boundaries between time and mind, memory
              and metaphor, emotion and experience. His unflinching willingness
              to invite the reader into even the most challenging of his
              experiences provides the floral archway to draw the reader to his
              side, whispering songs he hopes they might remember. Yet, he
              situates his feet firmly in the soil of science, allowing his
              rapid immersion into the world of research to be in equal measure
              bewildering, illuminating, orienting, and, ultimately heartening;
              there are real and substantive nuggets of knowledge to be learned
              from this book (a successful smuggling indeed)! Finally, like a
              confident jazz improviser, Mr. Keenan does not fear showing his
              work as he attempts to unearth the coherence and, perhaps, the
              meaning in each of the relationships he encounters. One cannot
              help but wonder while reading this book whether, in flickering
              moments, Mr. Keenan has trained his gaze (quizzically, patiently,
              cautiously) back on you. <br>
              <br>
              Thus, this is a book that can give an intimate picture and a deep
              history; it is a fountain of new scientific insights for a lay
              audience, and revelations for some. Most importantly, perhaps, it
              may offer a ray of hope – a beacon for those seeking understanding
              and clarity and a sense of belonging in the world. Not that Mr.
              Keenan makes this sound easy – instead, he shows both how hard
              this can be, and how valuable such a sense can be - precisely
              because it is so ephemeral. <br>
              <br>
