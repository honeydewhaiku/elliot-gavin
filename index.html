            <h1>Myself In My Own Words</h1>
            <div class="narrow"> Each step has a certain tension; the
              premeditated rhythm of his pacing evokes the mechanical motions of
              a Newton's cradle. <i>Click... click.</i> <br>
              <br>
              Yet there is a degree of self-awareness in his graceless stride -
              perhaps a consequence of being made aware of the awkwardness of
              his own movements from an early age. He is about five foot, with a
              compact physique. The impression he gives is androgynous if not
              for the dark stubble that traces his jaw. His hair - thick, coarse
              curls the color of charcoal - grazes the top of his perfectly
              round spectacles. He wears idiosyncracy like a favorite t-shirt.<br>
              <br>
              He doesn't quite look at you as he speaks. Nonetheless, with his
              gaze meandering about the room, he is quietly observant. He has an
              intelligent demeanor. When he speaks, his voice has a certain
              effervescence to it - a breathy timbre that somehow complements
              his careful articulation of speech. <br>
              <br>
              His conversational speech flows with a metrical rhythm,
              reminiscient of formal poetry thanks to its intentionality and
              constrained inflection. Yet, when he reads poetry aloud, his vocal
              prosody takes on a strikingly rhapsodic quality. Although he
              cannot sing, he believes his vocal range to be a <i>lyric tenor</i>.</div>

              <div class="big"> Elliot Gavin Keenan is 23 years old and a PhD
                student in Human Development &amp; Psychology at the University
                of California, Los Angeles. He is interested in creating
                statistical models of mental health conditions, drawing on his

            <h1>On Being Insane</h1>
            <div class="big">A lyrical memoir I wrote in my senior year of
              college, and published by Dreaming Big Publications in October
              2017.</div>
            <br>
            <br>
            The book is a mosaic of nonlinear fragments, highly experiential as
            it swirls through the speaker's deep-seated uneasiness with a
            subjective loss of himself and his memories. Yet while the past is
            held up to the light, the narrative is propelled forward by the
            rip-current of transition at the precipice of emerging adulthood. <i>On
              Being Insane</i> explores the notion of identity, navigates the
            liminal spaces of intersectionality, and ultimately sings in an
            unflinchingly honest celebration of the self.<br>

              department. But she told me that she used to write as if seized by
              a certain fervor for it, for the language, for poetry. I imagined
              Van Gogh and his passion for painting, his insatiable hunger. I
              thought I wanted to kiss those lips stained with yellow paint.
              Yellow, the color of the edges of a street, the boundaries of a
              self crossed like two neurons, the actualization of a synesthetic
              dream. To imbibe it is to take all of that in, the passion, life
              thrust under your tongue. I wanted that. </div>

            <div class="just"> <i>If I were to turn these love letters into a
                book, the inscription would be by Barthes, &amp; it would say:</i>
              To know that one does not write for the other, to know that these
              things I am going to write will never cause me to be loved by the
              one I love (the other), to know that writing compensates for
              nothing, sublimates nothing, that it is precisely <i>there where
                you are not</i> — this is the beginning of writing. <br>
              - Jenny Boully, <i>The Body: An Essay</i><br>
              <br>
              Basically, even in the midst of one of my attacks of melancholy, I
              was never too sure what to do with this life except love it, love
              it to distraction and tell it so: write love letters, illuminate
              the whiteness of a sheet of paper by sprinkling ink on it. [...]
              The composition of love letters is, to be sure, not a very serious
              occupation and lacks great economic importance. But if no one
              practiced it anymore, if no one reminded life of its own purity,
              then life would end up letting itself wither away and die, don’t
              you think?<br>
              - Christian Bobin, <i>I Never Dared Hope for You</i> <br>
              <br>
              It is with the reading of books the same as with looking at
              pictures; one must, without doubt, without hesitations, with
              assurance, admire what is beautiful. <br>
